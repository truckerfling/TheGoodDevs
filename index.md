1. Check out our list of partners and initiatives
2. Sign up as a volunteer at https://aka.ms/TGDvolunteer

## Who can volunteer?

We function like a mini end-to-end consultancy: from consultation, to project management, to development, to marketing. We are looking for **Project Managers, Engineers and Digital Marketers.**

## What kind of efforts do you support?

While all initiatives are important in this time of crisis, we focus on helping response efforts related to vulnerable groups (e.g. migrant workers, senior citizens, women and more) and those directly impacted by the virus (e.g. infected individuals and their families). This means we actively look to support such efforts. That said, we want to help where we can, so please don't hesitate to drop us a note with any effort related to this pandemic.
