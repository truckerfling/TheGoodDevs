## About

TL;DR IT support for ongoing response efforts to the current COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore 💻 

We understand that there are both short and long term effects from this pandemic. Therefore, we aim to partner with ongoing organized efforts to EITHER create new tech solutions to meet needs AND/OR enhance existing processes with tech to increase effectiveness. 

## 3 steps to help Singapore's COVID-19 efforts with tech

1. Check out what we do below, for a better understanding
2. Sign up as a volunteer at https://aka.ms/TGDvolunteer
3. We'll be in contact to offer you assignments 👩🏻‍💻👨🏽‍💻

## What kind of efforts do you support?

While all initiatives are important in this time of crisis, we focus on helping response efforts related to vulnerable groups (e.g. migrant workers, senior citizens, women and more) and those directly impacted by the virus (e.g. infected individuals and their families). This means we actively look to support such efforts - big or small, organization-run or community-initiated.

That said, we want to help where we can, so please don't hesitate to drop us a note with any effort related to this pandemic.

The projects we work on are planned to be short to mid-term, with lasting impact.

## Who can volunteer?

In crisis, many solutions are stop-gaps to deal with immediate needs. And in non-tech sectors, solutions may be mostly manual, with room for automation and more. 

We function like a mini end-to-end consultancy: from consultation, to project management, to development, to marketing. We are looking for **Project Managers, Engineers and Digital Marketers.**
